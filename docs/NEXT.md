# Where work stands (handoff for the next session)

Read this, CLAUDE.md, and the design doc "Farm game: buildings, end to end"
(https://claude.ai/artifact/BCxz5VHsfe6G7dSQnHLWsf) before starting. Don't re-read whole files: grep.

## Decided (in the design doc)
FarmVille footprints (with a save migration), FarmVille limits, the 5 planned buildings
(Greenhouse, Windmill, Juice Press, Spinning Mill, Silo) each get a job, materials buyable with gems.

## Done in phase 1
- Sizes are records (`sizes` in buildings.json; BuildingDef: capacity, size_name, size_materials, star_cost).
- `Game.buildings` (scripts/systems/building_system.gd): can_buy / can_expand / can_sell -> Verdict;
  limits (5 Dairy, 3 crafting, 1 of most); buy missing materials with gems. Tests 108-110.

## Next, in order
1. Footprints: Coop 3x2, Stable 3x4, Pig Pen 3x4, Bakery/Winery/Spa 4x3, Garden Shed 2x1 (buildings.json
   w/h) + adjust building_models.json bodies so test 107 still passes (long/short <= 1.4).
   Save v2: SAVE_VERSION 2, load accepts 1, and after loading, any object that no longer fits is moved to
   the nearest free spot (generic "settle" pass in load_game), with a message; test with a v1 save.
2. Market tabs by category (BuildingDef.tab()).
3. Phase 3 of the doc: each building its own silhouette; ready sparkle; broken Barn.
4. The 5 planned buildings, each with a job.

## How to work cheaply
- CI is the compiler: batch changes, push once, wait once (`until gh run list ... grep completed <sha>`).
- Read failures with: gh api .../jobs/<id>/logs | grep -E "  - |checks,|SCRIPT ERROR" | head
- Look at screenshots only when the look changed.
