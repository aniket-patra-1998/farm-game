Kept in the order we agreed: stress round done first, then visual detail, then the farming-core roadmap.

## Performance (stress round, part 2)
- Draw calls on the max farm: about 2,800 (was 8,000; the woods are baked per area and yard animals thin out
  when zoomed out). Next biggest: buildings (~45 surfaces each); use `tools/perf_probe` census to find them.
- Saving: a queued save now copies the farm (about 11 ms on the full-barn stress farm, was 25) and writes on a thread; pausing/closing still saves before returning.
- Off-screen free animals still think every second frame (cheap); building yards already throttle.
- 2D world in 3D mode: measured at 350 of 7,400 nodes, nothing per frame (the overlay and taps use it), so it stays; revisit only if memory matters.

## Ground: done
Meadow variety and bare earth, stronger lawn edge (mown border, earth lip, contact shade at the wall), forest floor under
the woods, worn dirt / shaded brick / stepping-stone paths, footprints and wheel tracks (Trails), pond and fountain banks.
Left as is: buildings already stand on a stone footing with contact shade and worn ground, so no extra berm; farmland keeps the plot soil material.

## Art (docs from the procedural art plan; checked against the code, all its findings hold)
Order: P0 fixed daylight showcase baseline -> P1 tree silhouettes (6-tree pilot: oak, mango, apple, willow, pine,
one fruit tree) -> P1 flower-bed and shrub compositions -> P1 ground tuft/flower variants and patches ->
P2 prop silhouettes -> P2 lighting calibration -> P3 distance simplification.
Rules we keep: no more balls to fix blobs; measure each step with the stress probe; no gameplay data, ids,
footprints or save changes; deterministic seeds; keep MultiMesh/bake.
- Vehicle models (bland): same pilot treatment. Also: sizes by kind (the Combine clearly bigger and heavier-looking than the Tractor, today all drawn alike in the Garage doorway), weight in the animation (slower, deeper bounce, dust), engine/wheel/work animations.
- Decoration detail kit (ridge caps, lanterns).

## Systems
- Save validation (SaveValidator, `add_object` invariants, migrations test).
- CI: fail on import errors, read-only permissions, SHA-pinned actions; README sync; Android export preset.
- HUD split, PlacementSystem, game.gd persistence module.

## Balance (the numbers)
- Review and tune every probability, chance and frequency in the game: how often the weather changes and how long
  each kind lasts, drop rates (parts, collectibles, finds, mystery boxes, strays), timers and payouts. Put them
  as named data (not buried in code), check each against FarmVille's, and add a tool that simulates a few days
  of play to show the effect of a change.

## Farming core
- Feeds and animal tastes (draft for review first), queen bee and flowers, adjacency synergies (super
  orchards), quests, boosts per home, Feed Mill/Nursery/dogs, look-test tool, central Feedback service.
